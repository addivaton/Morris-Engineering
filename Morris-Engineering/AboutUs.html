            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>
                Morris Engineering has been designing bridges since 1990.  
                Specializing in design of  prefabricated concrete, steel beam and railcar girder bridges spanning from about 20 - 140 feet or longer. 
                Bridge design services include topographical surveying of the bridge site, hydraulic/hydrology calculations, bridge plans, structural calculations, and construction review. 
                Other optional services we have provided include grading plans within the immediate bridge area, and assistance with County Building and California Department of Fish & Game permitting processes.  
                We have provided design services for hundreds of successful bridges to public agencies, private companies, developers, individual homeowners, and road associations.  
                Our cooperative team approach, and the bridges we design are excellent solutions for wineries, subdivisions, vineyards, golf courses, farming, timber, or other agricultural uses, fish passage projects, public utility access, public works projects, construction sites, and temporary or emergency access.
