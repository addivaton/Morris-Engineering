            <h2>Precast Concrete</h2>
            <p>Precast, prestressed concrete girders are formed in a fabrication yard, delivered, and installed at the bridge site by the fabrication company with experienced workers.
                Typically after the girders are in place, a cast-in-place concrete deck is poured.
                Precast prestressed girders are fabricated using high-strength steel and concrete subsequently the girders are lighter,
                more slender and aesthetically more appealing than standard cast-in-place reinforced concrete.
                Their lighter weight is particularly important in long-span girders where the dead load (weight) is a primary design factor.
                If construction time is a limiting factor, the precast prestressed concrete bridge would typically be faster to construct than a cast-in-place bridge.
                Precast concrete girders are routinely used in California and the western states by public agencies and private owners for bridge projects.
                There are various precast yards available throughout the western states providing fabrication of these girders.</p>

            <h2>Steel Beams and Trusses</h2>
            <p>Steel beams and trusses are commonly used for bridge girders providing a strong, light and economical solution for bridge spans.
                Steel Beams and Trusses have a long history of use for bridges.
                Steel beam bridges are often preferred in California as they consist of a lightweight superstructure material built on a solid foundation providing excellent performance during earthquakes.
                Trusses are built out of multiple members which is particularly useful at sites with difficult access.</p>

            <h2>Railcar Girders</h2>
            <p>Railroad flatcars (railcars) have been used for bridge superstructures for many years, but have received mixed reviews because not all railcars are the same.
                Railcars are an excellent use of an engineered structure made of recycled steel; 
                and, if the appropriate type of railcar is utilized, railcars have the structural integrity and sufficient strength for most bridge uses including heavy construction sites
                 (i.e. dirt moving tractor scrapers) and logging.</p>

            <h2>Cast-In-Place</h2>
            <p>Cast-In-Place involves pouring liquid concrete into removable forms and then dismantling the forms once the concrete has hardened to leave a solid form behind.
                The primary benefit of cast-in-place concrete is its high level of strength and is made even stronger by using steel reinforcement bars, or rebar, which is inserted in the form before the concrete is poured.
                It is also relatively resistant to structural damage in the event of an earthquake, flood or other natural disaster.</p>
